# Text-Based Game

This is a simple text-based game where the player controls a character within a grid-based world. The goal is to navigate the character to reach a specific destination while avoiding obstacles.
This project will use me to perform c++ and git basics.

## Getting Started

### Gameplay

    Use the WASD to move the character within the grid.
    Reach the destination ('$') to win the game.
    Avoid walls ('#') and obstacles ('@').

### Customize the Game

You can customize the game by modifying the source code. Some possible enhancements include:

    Adding more levels with different grid configurations.
    Introducing additional features to the enemie monsters.
